# Key Update: Support for Fine-Tuned t5-base Model
To accommodate developers and startups where frequent LLM API calls may not be feasible due to cost, latency, or dependency constraints, this tool now includes support for a fine-tuned t5-base model. The t5-base model is a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture designed to handle natural language processing tasks efficiently.
Download the fine-tuned model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H1J-SaVlIFbGj9HwJOluFZL7VcgU-0_C/view?usp=sharing). Training dataset is available inside:

```
android_app_testing_LLM/
â”œâ”€â”€ fine-tuned/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dataset
        â””â”€â”€ natural_language_dataset.csv
```

This option is ideal for scenarios where:

1. #### Machine configurations support local inference:
   - The t5-base model can be run on a GPU or CPU, depending on available resources.

2. #### Rapid response from large models is not a critical priority:
   - While t5-base may not match the inference speed or sophistication of large LLMs, it provides sufficient accuracy for many sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as generating app actions.

3. #### Local-only setups are preferred:
   - Avoid reliance on external API calls for LLM inference, which enhances data security and reduces operational costs.

### Advantages of Using t5-base
- Cost Efficiency: No recurring costs for API calls.
- Flexibility: Works offline if the model is downloaded and loaded locally.
- Customizable: Fine-tuning is possible to adapt the model to specific app testing use cases.

# How to Run the App

This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the app. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure the application works as expected.

---

## Pre-requisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1. **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**:
   - Installed and available in your system's PATH.
   - Verify installation by running:
     ```bash
     adb version
     ```

2. **Appium Server**:
   - Installed and running with relaxed security enabled.
   - Start Appium server using:
     ```bash
     appium --relaxed-security
     ```

3. **Python Environment**:
   - Python 3.10 is recommended.
   - A virtual environment is highly recommended to isolate dependencies.

4. **Connected Debug Device**:
   - Connect your Android device via USB or Wi-Fi.
   - Verify the connection using:
     ```bash
     adb devices
     ```
   - Ensure the device is listed under `adb devices` output.

5. **Streamlit Installed**:
   - Required to launch the app as a Streamlit web app.

6. **Application is installed in the Emulator**:
   - Whichever app name you will be mentioning in the playground, it must be installed in your emulator.

7. **OpenAI supported LLM inference credentials**:
   - Base URL of the inference
   - API key
   - LLM Model

### Create a ```.env``` with following credentials:
- OPENAI_BASE_URL
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- OPENAI_MODEL

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the application repository to your local machine.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/mohitsingh538/android_app_testing_LLM.git .
     cd android_app_testing_LLM
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Verify Appium and ADB Setup**:
   - Ensure Appium server is running:
     ```bash
     appium --relaxed-security
     ```
   - Confirm the device is connected using:
     ```bash
     adb devices
     ```

4. **Start the Application**:
   - Run the application using Streamlit:
     ```bash
     streamlit run main.py
     ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open the URL displayed in your terminal, typically:
     ```
     Local URL: http://localhost:8501
     Network URL: http://<your-local-ip>:8501
     ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes

1. **Device Not Detected**:
   - Ensure the device is in developer mode and USB debugging is enabled.
   - Check the device connection with:
     ```bash
     adb devices
     ```

2. **Appium Server Not Running**:
   - Start the server with:
     ```bash
     appium --relaxed-security
     ```

3. **Dependencies Not Installed**:
   - Ensure all Python dependencies are installed:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Port Conflicts**:
   - If Streamlit fails to start due to port conflicts, specify an alternate port:
     ```bash
     streamlit run main.py --server.port <port>
     ```
